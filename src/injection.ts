/*
 * The monkeypatch injection seam (development-plan §3.3, M0 proof).
 *
 * Stryker v9 has NO public "Mutator" plugin kind — the sixteen built-in mutators
 * are hardcoded into `@stryker-mutator/instrumenter` and there is no DI token to
 * register a new one. The verified-and-proven path (functional-architecture.md
 * §3) is to mutate the instrumenter's `allMutators` array IN PLACE:
 *
 *   • `mutators/mutate.js` exports `allMutators` as a plain, NON-frozen array.
 *   • `transformers/babel-transformer.js` reads it BY REFERENCE as the default
 *     value of its `mutators` parameter (`(..., mutators = allMutators) => ...`),
 *     then iterates `for (const mutator of mutators) for (const replacement of
 *     mutator.mutate(node))`.
 *   • Instrumentation runs IN-PROCESS in the main Stryker process. So mutating
 *     this one shared array instance — BEFORE Stryker calls `transformBabel` —
 *     changes exactly which mutators run, for free, with no plugin descriptor.
 *
 * HOW `allMutators` IS REACHED: the instrumenter's `package.json` `exports` map
 * only exposes `.` and `./package.json`, so `allMutators` is reached by RESOLVING
 * the package at runtime and dynamic-importing its internal `mutate.js` — see
 * `src/instrumenter-registry.ts`, the one module that does that resolution. We
 * import the resolved binding from there rather than via a static
 * `../node_modules/...` relative path: that static path only resolved when this
 * module sat beside THIS repo's `node_modules` (it points nowhere when hoisted in
 * a consumer's tree), and worse, the bundler INLINED a private copy of the array
 * into `dist/index.js` so injection silently no-op'd (M6 fix). Because ESM module
 * instances are singletons per resolved path, the array the registry resolves is
 * the SAME instance `babel-transformer.js` captured as its default parameter — so
 * pushing to it is observed by the next `transformBabel` call (proven offline in
 * `tests/injection/injection-proof.test.ts` and guarded by the canary's
 * resolution-parity invariant).
 *
 * This module is intentionally PURE and SYNCHRONOUS: it only mutates an array.
 * It contains NO `stryker run`, NO child-process spawn, and NO network code —
 * those belong to the driver (`scripts/m0-isambard-proof.mjs`), not here, which
 * keeps the injection logic trivially unit-testable.
